Inside of these chunks, lets call them A B and C, each person will be responsible for either one of the files or for one section of the file. A, B, and C will be developed in branches named appropriately for their purpose. Group meetings will take place twice a week at a time that works for everyone. Those who are working in the same chunk will need to keep in contact with each other and clearly understand what the other is doing such that they do not end up causing any conflicts. Commits can be pushed to branches outside of origin/main when the developer has reasonably tested changes made. Commits must also have a clear description of all changes made such that a person from outside the branch can understand what has been changed. Merges must be cleared with all of the other people involved in the project to make sure that no merge conflicts happen. After the coding portion of the project has been completed, each person will write up their section of the paper. They will then review and revise the whole paper after it has been put together."

    "2. I'm a bit unclear on what this means exactly, but there are a lot of different tabs on the documentation. I counted 67 different examples for figures on the main page.\n",
    "3. You can use plotly anytime you want, it offers a lot of things matplotlib doesn't, namely more interactive graphs that look very professional and takes less lines of code to do.\n",
    "4. Seaborn is the first one that comes to mind. It also aims to make great visualizations for data, and attempts to require less lines of code than matplotlib.\n",
    "5. Plotly allows you to create all kinds of advanced plots, from animations to geographic maps. I think one of the mosr useful ones would have to be the heatmap and also the line graphs with error bars. "
